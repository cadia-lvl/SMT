       "[' Research Design and Standards Organization  The Research Design and Standards Organisation (RDSO) is an ISO 9001 research and development organisation under the Ministry of Railways of India, which functions as a technical adviser and consultant to the Railway Board, the Zonal Railways, the Railway Production Units, RITES and IRCON International in respect of design and standardisation of railway equipment and problems related to railway construction, operation and maintenance. History. To enforce standardisation and co-ordination between various railway systems in British India, the Indian Railway Conference Association (IRCA) was set up in 1903. It was followed by the establishment of the Central Standards Office (CSO) in 1930, for preparation of designs, standards and specifications. However, till independence in 1947, most of the designs and manufacture of railway equipments was entrusted to foreign consultants. After independence, a new organisation called Railway Testing and Research Centre (RTRC) was set up in 1952 at Lucknow, for undertaking intensive investigation of railway problems, providing basic criteria and new concepts for design purposes, for testing prototypes and generally assisting in finding solutions for specific problems. In 1957, the Central Standards Office (CSO) and the Railway Testing and Research Centre (RTRC) were integrated into a single unit named Research Designs and Standards Organisation (RDSO) under the Ministry of Railways with its headquarters at Manaknagar, Lucknow. The status of RDSO was changed from an \"Attached Office\" to a \"Zonal Railway\" on April 1, 2003, to give it greater flexibility and a boost to the research and development activities. Organisation. The RDSO is headed by a Director General who ranks with a General Manager of a Zonal Railway. The Director General is assisted by an Additional Director General and 23 Sr. Executive Directors and Executive Directors, who are in charge of the 27 directorates: Bridges and Structures, the Centre for Advanced Maintenance Techlogy (AMTECH), Carriage, Geotechnical Engineering, Testing, Track Design, Medical, EMU & Power Supply, Engine Development, Finance & Accounts, Telecommunication, Quality Assurance, Personnel, Works, Psycho-Technical, Research, Signal, Wagon Design, Electric Locomotive, Stores, Track Machines & Monitoring, Traction Installation, Energy Management, Traffic, Metallurgical & Chemical, Motive Power and Library & Publications. All the directorates except Defence Research are located in Lucknow. Projects. Development of a new crashworthy design of  4500 HP WDG4 locomotive incorporating new  technology to improve dynamic braking and attain  significant fuel savings. Development of Drivers’ Vigilance Telemetric Control  System which directly measures and analyses variations  in biometric parameters to determine the state of alertness  of the driver. Development of Train Collision Avoidance System(TCAS). Development of Computer Aided Drivers Aptitude test  equipment for screening high speed train drivers for  Rajdhani/Shatabdi Express trains to evaluate their reaction  time, form perception, vigilance and speed anticipation. Assessment of residual fatigue life of critical railway  components like rail, rail weld, wheels, cylinder head, OHE  mast, catenary wire, contact wire, wagon components, low  components, etc. to formulate remedial actions. Modification of specification of Electric Lifting Barrier to improve its strength and reliability Design and development of modern fault tolerant, fail-safe, maintainer friendly Electronic Interlocking system Development of 4500 HP Hotel Load Locomotive to provide clean and noise free power supply to coaches from locomotive to eliminate the existing generator car of Garib Rath express trains. Field trials conducted for electric locomotive hauling Rajdhani/Shatabdi express trains with Head On Generation (HOG) system to provide clean and noise free power supply to end on coaches. Development of WiMAX technology to provide internet access to the passengers in running trains. Design and Development of Ballastless Track with indigenous fastening system (BLT-IFS). Major Achievements. Development of Pre-stressed concrete sleeper and allied components along with Source Development.  ',\n",
       " ' The Death of Bunny Munro  The Death of Bunny Munro is the second novel written by Nick Cave, best known as the lead singer of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. His first novel, \"And the Ass Saw the Angel\", was published in 1989. The novel deals with Bunny Munro, a middle aged lothario whose constant womanising and alcohol abuse comes to a head after the suicide of his wife. A travelling door to door beauty product salesman, he and his son go on an increasingly out of control road trip around Brighton, over which looms the shadow of a serial killer making his way towards Brighton, as well as Bunny\\'s own mortality. The novel is set in Brighton in 2003, around the time the West Pier was destroyed by fire. Many of the locations and street names used in the book relate to real places close to Cave\\'s own home. The novel was also released as an audiobook, using a 3D audio effect produced and sound directed by British artists Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard, with a soundtrack by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis and in a number of Ebook formats including an Enhanced Editions iPhone application that synchronises the audiobook with the text, and includes exclusive videos of Nick reading. A series of live events took place in late 2009 to promote the book under the title of \"A Night with Nick Cave\", combining music, readings and a Q&A session with the audience. Reception. Irvine Welsh, Neil Labute and David Peace have all touted the novel - providing back-cover reviews. Moreover, \"The Death of Bunny Munro\" has received strong reviews from the British media: Graeme Thomson (writing in The Observer, 6 September 2009) awarded the novel four stars. Likewise, the Saturday Times (on the 5th of September 2009) stated, in a very positive review, that the novel \"reads like a good indie movie\".  The novel was nominated for the Literary Review\\'s Bad Sex in Fiction Award, but did not win. ']"
